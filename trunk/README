* Installation

  You can install TorApplet from source with the usual commands:
     tar jxf torapplet0-<version>.tag.bz2
     cd torapplet0-<version>
     ./configure --with-torinitscript=/path/to/tor-init-script
     make
     make install [as root]
     killall bonobo-activation-server; killall gnome-panel

  If you downloaded the source from the SVN repository, you must use
  ./autogen.sh before the ./configure (it requires autoconf 2.59 and
  automake/aclocal 1.9).

  Depending on your distribution and tor installation, the tor init script
  to specify in ./configure can be /etc/init.d/tor or /etc/rc.d/init.d/tor
  If you want to start/stop/restart the Tor daemon from the applet, you
  should configure sudo to allow your account to do it.
  
  You can specify the standard ./configure command line options. If you
  specify with the --prefix option an installation directory other than
  /usr (the default is, as usual, /usr/local), make sure that the
  $prefix/lib/bonobo/servers is included in the bonobo-activation search
  path: you may need to set BONOBO_ACTIVATION_PATH environment variable
  or to edit /etc/bonobo-activation/bonobo-activation-config.xml
